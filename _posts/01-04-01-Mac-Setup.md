## Mac Setup  {#mac_setup_title}

OSX comes prepackaged with PHP but it is normally a little behind the latest stable. Lion comes with PHP 5.3.6,
Mountain Lion has 5.3.10, and Mavericks has 5.4.17.

To update PHP on OSX you can get it installed through a number of Mac [package managers][mac-package-managers], with
[php-osx by Liip][php-osx-downloads] being recommended.

You can also [compile it yourself][mac-compile]; if you do, be sure to have installed either Xcode or
Apple's substitute ["Command Line Tools for Xcode"][apple-developer], downloadable from Apple's Mac Developer Center.

For a complete "all-in-one" package that includes PHP, Apache web server and MySQL database, all with a nice graphical interface, try [MAMP][mamp-downloads] or [XAMPP][xampp].
